# Equalize-the-Array-algo
This code solves the Equalize the Array problem by finding the smallest number of deletions required to make all elements in the array the same. It counts how often each number appears, identifies the most frequent number, and calculates the number of deletions needed by subtracting this highest frequency from the total length of the array.
